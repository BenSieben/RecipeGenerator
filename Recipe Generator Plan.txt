//Planning the Recipe Generator (RG) program

For computer (.jar) (and mobile application? (android?))


//Computer version

Take in a .txt recipe to generate local HTML (& CSS) files that could be uploaded onto the internet
	+ Include a "SampleRecipe.txt" or something that lets users know proper formatting

Each recipe should follow a specific .txt format to be read

Allow user to add picture(s) of their recipe, either from online or from local pictures.
	+ This feature is probably only feasible through the GUI

Application should be a window where .txt files can be opened / drag and dropped

Also allow user to input data that will be translated to appropriate .txt and HTML files

The HTML files should also be accessible through another HTML file that sort recipes by date or name
	+ Maybe make this a separate generation from the recipes that can be called on manually

Save and create files in locations that makes uploading recipes to online website as easy as possible

//Mobile version?

Instead of making HTML files, we read the .txt files to be displayed on the mobile device
	+ Or, we figure out a way to make mobile-friendly HTML pages and display them in the app
